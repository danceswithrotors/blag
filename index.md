This is where you'll find some thoughts, some info about my professional projects and a [resume](resume_web.pdf)
 if you're looking into hiring or contracting a compliance-type person. 

For those who don't know, I've been at the compliance game for a while now, and I've done good things with great clients over the years, from helping build compliance programs to long-term maintenance of existing ones. If you want to drop me a line, I'm happy to talk to you about buiding your program too. Early-stage startups are my historical bread-and-butter, but I'm willing to work with businesses of all sizes and stages.
