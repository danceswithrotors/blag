This is where you'll find some thoughts, some info about my professional projects and a [resume](resume_web.pdf)
 if you're looking into hiring or contracting a compliance-type person. 

For those who don't know, I've been at the compliance game for a while now, and I've gotten to do cool things with great clients over the years, from helping build compliance programs to long-term maintenance of existing ones. 

Why you should listen to me? I've done security and compliance things for cool people whom I've named in my [resume](resume_web.pdf).
