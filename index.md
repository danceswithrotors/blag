This is where you'll find some thoughts, some info about my professional projects and a [resume](Cupples Resume Mar 27 2025.pdf)
 if you're looking into hiring or contracting a compliance-type person. 

For those who don't know, I've been at the compliance game for a while now, and I've gotten to do cool things with great clients over the years, from helping build compliance programs to long-term maintenance of existing ones. 

Why you should listen to me? You probably shouldn't, but if you need justification for paying me, I've done security things at Garmin, Cerner (pre-Oracle), Booz Allen Hamilton, Latacora, PwC and Observa, among others.
